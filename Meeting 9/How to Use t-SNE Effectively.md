Comments during the presentation
- Global features are typically useless, so t-SNE and other visualization methods minimize cost functions that have big penalty for mapping close points to distant points, but not for mapping distant points to close points.

- t-SNE is useful for getting an intuition on the raw, unlabeled data, as well as for analyzing the representations that NN create.
